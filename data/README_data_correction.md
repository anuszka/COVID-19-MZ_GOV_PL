### 2020-04-20: Data corrected!

Correction to my data. There was a [supplementary Twitter message on April 7](https://twitter.com/MZ_GOV_PL/status/1247569463823732739), which I did not note. As a result, in my plots, part of the increase in the number of confirmed cases from April 7 erroneously moved to April 8. This has been corrected since [cor.2020.04.20.csv](https://github.com/anuszka/COVID-19-MZ_GOV_PL/blob/master/data/cor.2020.04.20.csv).
